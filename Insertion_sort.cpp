/*
Ideas about this algorithm:
- The main idea of the algorithm is that we will sort each segment consisting of the first 1 element, the first 2 elements, â€¦, the N elements.

Advantages:
- If the list is mostly sorted, Insertion Sort will run very fast.

Disadvantages:
- The complexity is O(N2)
- Not fast enough for large data.
