# Stupid-Algorithms
My preparation for nothing after a long time .... every things is C++ or Python or any other language I know(F*** C++ I hate it)

Attention: 
- When comparing these algorithms with each other, there are many issues to pay attention to:
  1. Run time: For very large data, inefficient algorithms will run very slowly and cannot be applied in practice
  
  2. Memory: Fast algorithms that require recursion will likely have to make copies of the data being processed. For systems where memory is limited (e.g. embedded system), some algorithms will not be able to run
  
  3. Stability: Stability is defined based on what happens to elements of the same value
      + For a stable sorting algorithm, elements equal to equal value will remain in the same order in the array before sorting.
      + For an unstable sorting algorithm, elements with equal values can be of any order.
      
      
In this case, Suppose you need to sort the elements in ascending order. There are several ways to sort in descending order:
- Modify the algorithm accordingly.
- Sort, then reverse the order of the elements.
- Redefine the smaller comparison.

Thanks for reading this shit. Have a gud day!!!
